main.py is the driver for the League of Legends interactive adventure game by Joe Vander Ploeg.

This program uses Python 2.7.6 and is designed to operate through a console interface.  Simply navigate to the directory where the file is located and enter "python main.py" to start the game.

Enter a single integer to select a course of action at each stage of the game.  The goal is to make wise decisions and collect as much gold as possible during the early game.

Events 2 and 3 as well as the end game results were added after the class presentation.
